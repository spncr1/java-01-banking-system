## Description

**SimpleBank Java CLI** is a terminal-based banking system built in Java. It allows users to create accounts, log in securely, and perform basic banking operations like checking balances, depositing, and withdrawing money.  
The project was designed to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) fundamentals and clean code structure, which is why logic is separated into multiple classes: `User`, `BankAccount`, `BankSystem`, and the `Main` entry point.  
This modular approach makes the code more readable, maintainable, and scalable, and demonstrates good software engineering practices for real-world Java applications.

## Features

- ðŸ”¹ Create new user accounts with unique usernames and passwords
